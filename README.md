## Learnings

Really happy with the new course order for TOP.

I used a lot of the new things I learned from the intermediate HTML/CSS course in this project, such as CSS grid.

This was the first project where I decided to use all arrow functions.

It took me a bit to wrap my head around how to use factory functions and IFFE for this project but after completing the project I have a better understanding on when to use them and why they are useful.
