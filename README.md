## Learnings
Really happy with the new course order for TOP. I used a lot of the new things I learned from the intermediate HTML/CSS course in this project. This was the first project where I decided use all arrow functions. It took me a bit to wrap my head around how to use factory functions and IFFE for this project but after completing the project I have a better understanding on when to use them and why they are useful.
